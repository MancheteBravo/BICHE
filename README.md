# BICHE
She is an AI that can play Ultimate Chicken Horse


So the comments are in french but for now if
you have questions you can ask me. This is to play easy level that I built myself in challenge mode using the sheep in Ultimate Chicken Horse. The game needs to be in windowed mode and you need to have 1920 x 1080 res on your main screen. The code is all in one code because why not, but I will clean it up in due time.

THIS IS A DQN Algorithm using only the screen's input and playing one of 8 possible moves allowed to BICHE.
This is a frankenstein algorithm based on the DQN tutorial on the pytorch website that plays cartpole using only the screen inputs,
the keras AI that plays flappy birds, SethBling's mari/o and mariflow alroithms and SerpentAI's magnificent framework.

When I wanted to try this, I found a lot of tutorials assumed that you knew a lot more than you actulally do. The object here is to try to be as transparent as I can be. If you have any questions or commentaries please feel free to communicate with me.

RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T PICKLE WHAT IT HAS LEARNED

Also, I haven't finished tweeking the reward system.


Enjoy!
